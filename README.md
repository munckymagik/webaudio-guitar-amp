A virtual guitar amp in the browser. Written at the [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com/) Web Audio Hack Day 2015.

# Running Locally

Sorry nothing specific provided, but I suggest installing `http-server` using NPM then run

```bash
http-server . -c0
```

... in the project folder.

Then open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
